# Service Observability Plan

Describe the metrics, logs, and traces that prove this service is healthy. Inherit global goals from `../../platform/OBSERVABILITY.md` and add service-level KPIs here.

## Metrics
| Metric | Purpose | Target | Dashboard |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Logs
- Structured log format (fields, PII rules)
- Sampling strategy

## Traces
- Key spans, attributes, and sampling configuration

## Alerts
| Alert | Condition | Severity | Channel | Runbook |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Specification by Example
Document scenarios that tie telemetry to behavior (e.g., "Given checkout latency >500ms for 5 minutes, alert X fires").
